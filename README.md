# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Project Overview
The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a machine learning-based project designed to detect and prevent unauthorized access and suspicious activities in a computer network. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to analyze network traffic and identify potential security threats.

## Project Structure
**dataset:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing. Needs to be extracted before use.
**src/:** Source code for the NIDS implementation.
**research_papers/:** Contains Reasearch Papers used as a reference for the NIDS.
**README.md:** This readme file.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- csv
- Some other basic python modules

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankitsharma58/network-intrusion-detection.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd network-intrusion-detection
```
Install the required dependencies (as mentioned in the Requirements section).

You're now ready to use the NIDS!

## Usage

- Train the machine learning models using the provided dataset. The dataset should be placed in the data/ directory after extraction of dataset zipfile.
- Modify the hyperparameters and settings for each algorithm in the source code (in the src/ directory) according to your requirements.
- Run the NIDS to detect network intrusions.
- Evaluate the performance of the NIDS using appropriate metrics (details in the Performance Metrics section).
- Fine-tune the models and parameters as necessary to achieve the desired level of detection accuracy.

## Dataset
The NIDS project uses a dataset of network traffic data. You can replace the dataset in the zipfile with your own data, provided that it is in a compatible format. The dataset used should include both normal and malicious network traffic samples for training and testing.

## Algorithms
Various methods have been proposed for building a Network Intrusion Detection System, which are based on:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naïve Bayes Classifier
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

You can choose the algorithm that best fits your network security requirements and customize the settings accordingly in the source code.

## Performance Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the NIDS, the following metrics can be considered:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
